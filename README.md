## Introduction

Bookchat is a full-stack social platform designed to bring people together through a shared love of reading. Inspired by my experience teaching English literature at UCLA during the pandemic and running a philosophy book club with friends, Bookchat makes it easy to build community around books â€” no matter where you're from.

With Bookchat, users can:

 + Discover books across a variety of genres
 + Create and join bookshelves and bookclubs
 + Add books to personal or shared spaces
 + Collaborate with club members using polls to choose the next read
 + Invite others to participate in ongoing discussions

Future features will include:
  + A smart bookclub recommendation algorithm
  + Event scheduling
  + Integration with Zoom and Google Meet
