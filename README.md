## Introduction

Bookchat is a social media app centered around bringing folks together from all different backgrounds around a shared love reading. Borne out of my experience during the pandemic teaching English literature to UCLA undergraduates and maintaining a philosophy bookclub with friends, Bookchat is a full stack app where users can browse books from a range of genres, create bookshelves and bookclubs, add books to either and create polls with other bookclub members to decide the next read. Users can invite other members to join a bookclub. Future functionality will include a bookclub recommendation algorithm, a scheduler, and integration with Zoom and Google Meet. Head on over to the <a href="#documentation">Documentation</a> for more information on how to use Bookchat. Happy reading!
