3,"Oliver Twist Illustrated",none,"""Oliver Twist; or, the Parish Boy's Progress is Charles Dickens's second novel, and was first published as a serial 1837-39.[1] The story centres on orphan Oliver Twist, born in a workhouse and sold into apprenticeship with an undertaker. After escaping, Oliver travels to London, where he meets """"The Artful Dodger"""", a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal, Fagin.Oliver Twist is notable for its unromantic portrayal by Dickens of criminals and their sordid lives, as well as for exposing the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid-19th century.[2] The alternative title, The Parish Boy's Progress, alludes to Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, as well as the 18th-century caricature series by William Hogarth, A Rake's Progress and A Harlot's Progress.[3]In this early example of the social novel, Dickens satirises the hypocrisies of his time, including child labour, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens's own youthful experiences contributed as well.Oliver Twist has been the subject of numerous adaptations for various media, including a highly successful musical play, Oliver!, and the multiple Academy Award-winning 1968 motion picture. Disney also put its spin on the novel with the animated film called Oliver & Company in 1988""","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9798693732179""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=giD4zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=giD4zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api""}",582,1

East and West. Humans and Spirits. Breccans and Tamerlaines. The Isle of Cadence has always held itself and its residents in a tenuous balance. But now Bane, the spirit of the North Wind, has pushed everyone and everything in his path off-kilter in a bid to claim dominion over human and spirit alike. In the East, a sickness is spreading through the orchards, affecting the people of the Tamerlaine clan. As their healer, Sidra desperately searches for a cure while her husband Torin, the clan's new leader, attempts to draw answers from the spirits. But humans were never meant to walk for long amongst the elementals, and the deeper he strays into their realm, the further lost he and the clan become. In the West, Adaira finds it hard to adjust to the more brutal way of life that the Breccans embrace. Both the clan and the spirits suffer beneath Bane's command, whose growing power can be felt in every gust of wind. With the island falling further out of balance, Jack decides to take up his harp and cross the clan line, to not only reunite with Adaira but to unravel a sinister mystery that would grant him the knowledge to defeat Bane and restore peace to the isle. Yet no one can challenge the North Wind without paying a price, and the sacrifice required this time may just be the ultimate one.Torin, and Sidra can bear to pay.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0063056046""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780063056046""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qh6UzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qh6UzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api""}",0,15

King Henry VIII, her new husband, instantly dislikes her. Without friends, family, or even an understanding of the language being spoken around her, she must literally save her neck in a court ruled by a deadly game of politics and the terror of an unpredictable and vengeful king. Her Boleyn Inheritance: accusations and false witnesses. KATHERINE HOWARD She catches the king's eye within moments of arriving at court, setting in motion the dreadful machine of politics, intrigue, and treason that she does not understand. She only knows that she is beautiful, that men desire her, that she is young and in love -- but not with the diseased old man who made her queen, beds her night after night, and killed her cousin Anne. Her Boleyn Inheritance: the threat of the axe. JANE ROCHFORD She is the Boleyn girl whose testimony sent her husband and sister-in-law to their deaths. She is the trusted friend of two threatened queens, the perfectly loyal spy for her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and a canny survivor in the murderous court of a most dangerous king. Throughout Europe, her name is a byword for malice, jealousy, and twisted lust. Her Boleyn Inheritance: a fortune and a title, in exchange for her soul. The Boleyn Inheritance is a novel drawn tight as a lute string about a court ruled by the gallows and three women whose positions brought them wealth, admiration, and power as well as deceit, betrayal, and terror.

It was first published serially in the journal The Russian Messenger in 1868-9. The title is an ironic reference to the central character of the novel, Prince Lyov Nikolaevich Myshkin, a young man whose goodness and open-hearted simplicity lead many of the more worldly characters he encounters to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence and insight. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting ""the positively good and beautiful man."" The novel examines the consequences of placing such a unique individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires, passions and egoism of worldly society, both for the man himself and for those with whom he becomes involved. The result, according to philosopher A.C.

25,"A Study in Scarlet",anboco,"A Study in Scarlet, detective novel by Conan Doyle, written in 1886, the story marks the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who would become two of the most famous characters in popular fiction. The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes, an amateur detective, to his friend and chronicler Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his ""study in scarlet"": ""There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it."" The story, and its main characters, attracted little public interest when it first appeared. Only 11 complete copies of the magazine in which the story first appeared, Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887, are known to exist now and they have considerable value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories featuring Holmes, A Study in Scarlet is one of only four full-length novels in the original canon. The novel was followed by The Sign of the Four, published in 1890. A Study in Scarlet was the first work of detective fiction to incorporate the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9783736417281""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""3736417284""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_wyvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_wyvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",164,8

27,"The Festival of Insignificance",HarperCollins,"“Slender but weighty. . . . What is moving about this novel is its embrace of what has always driven Kundera, the delicate state of living between being and nothingness.”— Boston Globe From the internationally acclaimed, bestselling author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, an entertaining and enchanting novel—""a fitting capstone on an extraordinary career."" (Slate) Casting light on the most serious of problems and at the same time saying not one serious sentence; being fascinated by the reality of the contemporary world and at the same time completely avoiding realism—that’s The Festival of Insignificance. Readers who know Milan Kundera’s earlier books know that the wish to incorporate an element of the “unserious” in a novel is not at all unexpected of him. In Immortality, Goethe and Hemingway stroll through several chapters together talking and laughing. And in Slowness, Vera, the author’s wife, says to her husband: “you’ve often told me you meant to write a book one day that would have not a single serious word in it…I warn you: watch out. Your enemies are lying in wait.” Kundera is finally and fully realizing his old aesthetic dream in this novel that we could easily view as a summation of his whole work. A strange sort of summation. Strange sort of epilogue. Strange sort of laughter, inspired by our time, which is comical because it has lost all sense of humor. What more can we say? Nothing.

Drawn from the authoritative Library of America volume of Hemingway’s early writings, this deluxe paperback presents a new, corrected text of The Sun Also Rises prepared by a leading Hemingway scholar based on study of manuscripts and typescripts and later printings in Hemingway’s lifetime. Correcting numerous errors, restoring key changes made to his original punctuation—most notably in the novel’s famous final line—and reinstating references to real people removed by his editor Maxwell Perkins for fear of libel or scandal, Library of America’s authoritative text brings us closer to the novel as Hemingway envisioned it. Hemingway's landmark novel follows two of his most memorable characters—Jake Barnes, an American newspaper correspondent living in Paris, and the impossible object of his affections, Lady Brett Ashley—and a cohort of other young American and British expatriates, amidst their dizzying, alcohol-fueled exploits in interwar France and Spain. Brimming with the headlong vivacity of Parisian nightlife, the manic energy of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and the rich color of the Spanish countryside, the book is also a poignant portrait of disillusionment and loss, “such a hell of a sad story,” as Hemingway described it in a letter to his friend and rival F. Scott Fitzgerald. This keepsake edition includes a number of special features: a selection of Hemingway’s vivid journalistic accounts of bullfighting in Spain and the expat community in Paris; letters to Fitzgerald, Perkins, and others that illuminate the process of writing and publishing The Sun Also Rises; a detailed chronology of Hemingway’s life and career; and extensive explanatory and textual notes.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781598537161""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1598537164""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YEAnEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YEAnEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",303,1

When the book is published the following year, a letter turns up in Zimmer's mailbox bearing a return address from a small town in New Mexico-supposedly written by Hector's wife. ""Hector has read your book and would like to meet you. Are you interested in paying us a visit?"" Is the letter a hoax, or is Hector Mann still alive? Torn between doubt and belief, Zimmer hesitates, until one night a strange woman appears on his doorstep and makes the decision for him, changing his life forever. This stunning novel plunges the reader into a universe in which the comic and the tragic, the real and the imagined, the violent and the tender dissolve into one another.

While The Pioneers was published in 1823, before any of the other Leatherstocking Tales, the period of time it covers makes it the fourth chronologically. The story takes place on the rapidly advancing frontier of New York State and features a middle-aged Leatherstocking (Natty Bumppo), Judge Marmaduke Temple of Templeton, whose life parallels that of the author's father Judge William Cooper, and Elizabeth Temple (the author's sister Susan Cooper), of Cooperstown. The story begins with an argument between the Judge and the Leatherstocking over who killed a buck, and as Cooper reviews many of the changes to New York's Lake Otsego, questions of environmental stewardship, conservation, and use prevail. The plot develops as the Leatherstocking and Chingachgook begin to compete with the Temples for the loyalties of a mysterious young visitor, ""Oliver Edwards,"" the ""young hunter,"" who eventually marries Elizabeth. Chingachgook dies, exemplifying the vexed figure of the ""dying Indian,"" and Natty vanishes into the sunset.

The descriptions, rich in the warm colors of the South, convey Lagerlvf's understanding of the hot blooded Sicilians with the same insight and sympathy which she evokes while describing the introspective Swedes. Lagerlvf borrows from an ancient Sicilian legend which says, ""When Antichrist comes he shall seem as Christ. There shall be great want, and Antichrist shall go from land to land and give bread to the poor. And he shall find many followers."" Masterfully, she intertwines a tale of modern Sicily in an era when revolutionary socialism is sweeping the island and making heavy inroads upon the influence of the church. Selma Ottiliana Lovisa Lagerlvvf (1858-1940) was born in Sweden. She had been writing poetry ever since she was a child, but she did not publish anything until 1890, when a Swedish newspaper gave her the first prize in a literary competition and published excerpts from her first novel, Gvsta Berlings Saga (published in 1891 and very successful). During her travels to Italy she wrote The Miracles of Antichrist in 1897. After several minor works she published Jerusalem (translated in English as The Holy City) but it was with The Wonderful Adventures of Nils, a book for children, that she became recognized worldwide.

64,"The Double","Read Books Ltd","“The Double” is a novella by Russian novelist, essayist, short story writer, journalist, and philosopher Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821 – 1881). His literature famously examines human psychology during the turbulent social, spiritual and political atmosphere of 19th-century Russia, and he is considered one of the greatest psychologists in world literature. Originally published in “Fatherland Notes”, “The Double” was revised and republished by Dostoevsky in 1866. The story revolves around a government employee who begins to encounter someone who looks exactly like him, but who possesses a completely dissimilar personality to the weak and introverted main character. The narrative deals primarily with the internal psychological struggle of the protagonist as he seemingly descends into madness. A prolific writer, Dostoevsky produced 11 novels, three novellas, 17 short stories and numerous other works. This volume is not to be missed by fans of Russian literature and constitutes a must-read for lovers of Dostoevsky's seminal work. Many vintage books such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive.

Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them. With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant. She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise. Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret. Friends, enemies, lovers.

In Crime and Punishment, when Raskolnikov, an impoverished student living in the St. Petersburg of the tsars, commits an act of murder and theft, he sets into motion a story that is almost unequalled in world literature for its excruciating suspense, its atmospheric vividness, and its depth of characterization and vision. Dostoevsky’s drama of sin, guilt, and redemption transforms the sordid story of an old woman’s murder into the nineteenth century’s profoundest and most compelling philosophical novel.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780307829603""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""030782960X""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U5NhxE67JjMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U5NhxE67JjMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",591,1

Coetzee reimagines Daniel DeFoe's classic novel Robinson Crusoe in Foe. Published as a Penguin Essential for the first time. In an act of breathtaking imagination, J.M Coetzee radically reinvents the story of Robinson Crusoe. In the early eighteenth century, Susan Barton finds herself adrift from a mutinous ship and cast ashore on a remote desert island. There she finds shelter with its only other inhabitants: a man named Cruso and his tongueless slave, Friday. In time, she builds a life for herself as Cruso's companion and, eventually, his lover. At last they are rescued by a passing ship, but only she and Friday survive the journey back to London. Determined to have her story told, she pursues the eminent man of letters Daniel Foe in the hope that he will relate truthfully her memories to the world. But with Cruso dead, Friday incapable of speech and Foe himself intent on reshaping her narrative, Barton struggles to maintain her grip on the past, only to fall victim to the seduction of storytelling itself. Treacherous, elegant and unexpectedly moving, Foe remains one of the most exquisitely composed of this pre-eminent author's works.

They're complex tales, but since Andersen himself was pretty complex, we like to think that art imitates life. Or something like that. Thumbelina is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen first published by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen, Denmark with ""The Naughty Boy"" and ""The Traveling Companion"" in the second installment of Fairy Tales Told for Children. ""Thumbelina"" is about a tiny girl and her adventures with appearance- and marriage-minded toads, moles, and cockchafers. She successfully avoids their intentions before falling in love with a flower-fairy prince just her size.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1727682602""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781727682601""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-LQHvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-LQHvgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api""}",34,15

When advertising artist Si Morley is recruited to join a covert government operation exploring the possibility of time travel, he jumps at the chance to leave his mundane 20th-century existence and step into the past. But he also has another motivation for going back in time: a half-burned letter that tells of a mysterious, tragic death and ominously of “fire which will destroy the whole world.” Traveling to New York City in January 1882 to investigate, he finds a Manhattan teeming with a different kind of life, the waterfront unimpeded by skyscrapers, open-air markets packed with activity, Central Park bustling with horse drawn sleighs—a city on the precipice of great things. At first, Si welcomes these trips as a temporary escape but when he falls in love with a woman he meets in the past, he must choose whether to return to modern life or live in 1882 for good. “Pure New York fun” (Alice Hoffman, New York Times bestselling author), Time and Again is meticulous recreation of New York in the late nineteenth century, exploring the possibilities of time travel to tell an ageless story of love, longing, and adventure.

101,"Ernest Hemingway Super Pack",unknown,"Ernest Hemingway was one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, known for his distinctive prose style and his exploration of the human condition. His literary journey began during World War One, where he served as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross. The war profoundly impacted him, shaping his world view and informing much of his later work. Hemingway is often associated with the ""Lost Generation,"" a term coined by Gertrude Stein to describe a group of American expatriates who felt disillusioned by the devastation of World War One. In Paris during the 1920s, Hemingway became a central figure in the expatriate literary scene, mingling with other luminaries such as Gertrude Stein, who became a mentor and a significant influence on his writing. Stein's avant-garde ideas and her salon gatherings provided a fertile ground for Hemingway's artistic development. Her encouragement helped him refine his minimalist style, which would later define his most celebrated works such as A Farewell to Arms. Hemingway's early books all explore the disillusionment of the lost generation in the aftermath of World War One. His breath taking economical style shook up the literary field and made him a giant of literature. Included in this omnibus collection are Three Short Stories & Ten Poems, In Our Time, The Torrents of Spring, The Sun Also Rises, Men Without Women, and A Farewell to Arms.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1515463087""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781515463085""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O-fj0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O-fj0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api""}",0,1

In A Happy Death, written when Albert Camus was in his early twenties and retrieved from his private papers following his death in 1960, revealed himself to an extent that he never would in his later fiction. For if A Happy Death is the study of a rule-bound being shattering the fetters of his existence, it is also a remarkably candid portrait of its author as a young man. As the novel follows the protagonist, Patrice Mersault, to his victim's house -- and then, fleeing, in a journey that takes him through stages of exile, hedonism, privation, and death -it gives us a glimpse into the imagination of one of the great writers of the twentieth century. For here is the young Camus himself, in love with the sea and sun, enraptured by women yet disdainful of romantic love, and already formulating the philosophy of action and moral responsibility that would make him central to the thought of our time.

Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and thereby exposes herself to the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust and sometimes shocking qualities of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice.

The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and “the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick.” Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning. A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781476770093""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1476770093""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AdFQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AdFQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",376,21

Poets, novelists and writers have once again collaborated with people who have experienced detention, their tales appearing alongside first-hand accounts by people who themselves have been detained.

134,"Christian Metaphysics and Neoplatonism","University of Missouri Press","Contemporary scholarship tends to view Albert Camus as a modern, but he himself was conscious of the past and called the transition from Hellenism to Christianity ""the true and only turning point in history."" For Camus, modernity was not fully comprehensible without an examination of the aspirations that were first articulated in antiquity and that later received their clearest expression in Christianity. These aspirations amounted to a fundamental reorientation of human life in politics, religion, science, and philosophy. Understanding the nature and achievement of that reorientation became the central task of Christian Metaphysics and Neoplatonism. Primarily known through its inclusion in a French omnibus edition, it has remained one of Camus' least-read works, yet it marks his first attempt to understand the relationship between Greek philosophy and Christianity as he charted the movement from the Gospels through Gnosticism and Plotinus to what he calls Augustine's ""second revelation"" of the Christian faith. Ronald Srigley's translation of this seminal document helps illuminate these aspects of Camus' work. His freestanding English edition exposes readers to an important part of Camus' thought that is often overlooked by those concerned primarily with the book's literary value and supersedes the extant McBride translation by retaining a greater degree of literalness. Srigley has fully annotated Christian Metaphysics to include nearly all of Camus' original citations and has tracked down many poorly identified sources. When Camus cites an ancient primary source, whether in French translation or in the original language, Srigley substitutes a standard English translation in the interest of making his edition accessible to a wider range of readers. His introduction places the text in the context of Camus' better-known later work, explicating its relationship to those mature writings and exploring how its themes were reworked in subsequent books. Arguing that Camus was one of the great critics of modernity through his attempt to disentangle the Greeks from the Christians, Srigley clearly demonstrates the place of Christian Metaphysics in Camus' oeuvre. As the only stand-alone English version of this important work-and a long-overdue critical edition-his fluent translation is an essential benchmark in our understanding of Camus and his place in modern thought.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780826266224""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0826266223""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e_myYMkRuN4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e_myYMkRuN4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",161,19

A Christmas Carol recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After their visits, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols and newer customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story.

Rudyard Kipling pours fuel on childhood fantasies with his tales of Mowgli, lost in the jungles of India as a child and adopted into a family of wolves. Mowgli is brought up on a diet of Jungle Law, loyalty, and fresh meat from the kill. Regular adventures with his friends and enemies among the Jungle-People-cobras, panthers, bears, and tigers-hone this man-cub's strength and cleverness and whet every reader's imagination. Mowgli's story is interspersed with other tales of the jungle, such as ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,"" lending depth and diversity to our understanding of Kipling's India. In much the same way Mowgli is carried away by the Bandar-log monkeys, young readers will be caught up by the stories, swinging from page to page, breathless, thrilled, and terrified.It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in the tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived. ""Augrh!"" said Father Wolf, ""it is time to hunt again""; and he was going to spring downhill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: ""Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves; and good luck and strong white teeth go with the noble children, that they may never forget the hungry in this world.""It was the jackal-Tabaqui, the Dish-licker-and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps.

Even the tiger hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature.

In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight,” and one of the foremost classics of war literature in history. Published in 1940, For Whom the Bell Tolls tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. Robert Jordan is a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan’s love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo’s last stand, Hemingway creates a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. “If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,” Maxwell Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, “no one ever so completely performed it.” Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author’s previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time. Featuring early drafts and manuscript notes, some of Hemingway’s writings during the Spanish Civil War, and three previously collected stories of his on the subject of war, as well as a personal foreword by the author’s son Patrick Hemingway, and a new introduction by the author’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this edition of For Whom the Bell Tolls brings new life to a literary master’s epic like never before.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781476787831""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1476787832""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jS2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jS2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",576,1

He condemns the politics and thought of the age, brings comfort to the “insulted and injured,” and gains the love of two women suggestive of the biblical Mary and Martha. But there is a sinister side of him: in his vest he carries a vial of prussic acid...

Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in France in 1823. Shelley had travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river Rhine in Germany with a stop in Gernsheim which is just 17 km (10 mi) away from Frankenstein Castle, where, two centuries before, an alchemist was engaged in experiments. Later, she travelled in the region of Geneva (Switzerland)-where much of the story takes place-and the topic of galvanism and other similar occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, Percy Shelley. Mary, Percy, Lord Byron, and John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story.

157,"Correspondence, 1932-1960","U of Nebraska Press","As a philosophy teacher, mentor, and friend, Jean Grenier (1898?1971) had an enormous influence on the young Albert Camus (1913?1960), who, in fact, acknowledged that Grenier?s Les Iles had touched the very core of his sensibility and provided him with both a ?terrain for reflection, and a format? that he would later use for his own essays. Their correspondence, beginning when the seventeen-year-old Camus was Grenier?s student at the Grand Lycäe of Algiers, documents the younger man?s struggle to become a writer and find his own voice, a period in which he turned frequently to his mentor for advice, comfort, and direction. The letters cover a period of almost thirty years, from 1932 to Camus?s untimely death in 1960. Because Camus destroyed the earlier correspondence he received, the first twenty-six letters in the volume are his only; the full begins in 1940. ø These enlightening letters offer invaluable glimpses into the development of Camus?s aesthetic ideas, literary production, and political stance. In contrast to the correspondence of Grenier, who throughout remains somewhat reticent about his life and doubtful about himself and his works, Camus?s letters are a window into his most profound thoughts and sensitivities, delving deeply into his psyche and, at times, revealing a side of the writer unfamiliar to us. Undoubtedly they allow us a better understanding of Albert Camus, the man and the artist.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0803214979""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780803214972""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z5uX5zjR30wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z5uX5zjR30wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",312,20

160,"Counting Miracles","Random House","#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the acclaimed author of The Longest Ride and The Notebook comes an emotional, powerful novel about wondering if we can change—or even make our peace with—the path we’ve taken. “Sparks is superb at what he does. The setting is postcard perfect. The characters are immensely likable. . . . This is a tidy miracle you can count on.”—The Washington Post Tanner Hughes was raised by his grandparents, following in his grandfather’s military footsteps to become an Army Ranger. His whole life has been spent abroad, and he is the proverbial rolling stone: happiest when off on his next adventure, zero desire to settle down. But when his grandmother passes away, her last words to him are find where you belong. She also drops a bombshell, telling him the name of the father he never knew—and where to find him. Tanner is due at his next posting soon, but his curiosity is piqued, and he sets out for Asheboro, North Carolina, to ask around. He’s been in town less than twenty-four hours when he meets Kaitlyn Cooper, a doctor and single mom. They both feel an immediate connection; Tanner knows Kaitlyn has a story to tell, and he wants to hear it. To Kaitlyn, Tanner is mysterious, exciting—and possibly leaving in just a few weeks. Meanwhile, nearby, eighty-three-year-old Jasper lives alone in a cabin bordering a national forest. With only his old dog, Arlo, for company, he lives quietly, haunted by a tragic accident that took place decades before. When he hears rumors that a white deer has been spotted in the forest—a creature of legend that inspired his father and grandfather—he becomes obsessed with protecting the deer from poachers. As these characters’ fates orbit closer together, none of them is expecting a miracle . . . but that may be exactly what is about to alter their futures forever.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9798217013999""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Md0JEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Md0JEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",465,18

It is a daring adventure novel, with a riveting plot and powerful conclusion perfect for anyone who loved ‘The Thing’. Jules Verne (1828-1905) was a French novelist, poet and playwright who is remembered for his significant contribution to the science fiction genre. With the help of editor Pierre-Jules Hetzel he wrote a series of books called ""Extraordinary Travels"", which includes ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" (1864), ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" (1870), and ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" (1873). Due to his incredible vision he is often given the moniker ‘The Father of Science Fiction’, shared with fellow science fiction author H.G. Wells. Widely popular with both children and adults, Verne is one of the most translated authors of all time, second only to Agatha Christie and Shakespeare.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9788726647693""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""8726647699""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yLJREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yLJREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",283,1

Day/Night brings together two metaphysical novels that mirror each other and are meant to be read in tandem: two men, each confined to a room, one suddenly alert to his existence, the other desperate to escape into sleep. In Travels in the Scriptorium, elderly Mr. Blank wakes in an unfamiliar cell, with no memory of who he is or how he got there. He must use the few objects he finds and the information imparted by the day's string of visitors to cobble together an idea of his identity. In Man in the Dark, another old man, August Brill, suffering from insomnia, struggles to push away thoughts of painful personal losses by imagining what might have been. Who are we? What is real and not real? How does the political intersect with the personal? After great loss, why are some of us unable to go on?

167,Go,"Open Road Media","Before the world knew Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Cassady, this “brilliant and important” novel chronicled the author’s early years among the Beats (Los Angeles Free Press). Published five years before On the Road, this candid and perceptive roman à clef chronicles the adventures of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Neal Cassady before they became literary icons. In dive bars and all-night diners, cabs racing across Manhattan and squalid apartments sticky with “tea” smoke, these would-be artists pursue the ecstatic experiences that shape their work and satisfy their restless desire to live beyond the limits of convention. At the heart of Go is Paul Hobbes, the alter ego of John Clellon Holmes. An aspiring novelist who shares the same creative interests as his friends, Paul frequently participates in their reckless, self-indulgent behavior. Yet his innate solemnness makes him an outsider, as does his commitment to his marriage. As Paul seeks to strike the right balance between experimentation and orthodoxy, freedom and obligation, he casts a discerning eye on his peers. The result is a thrilling and indispensible portrait of the Beat movement before it took America by storm.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781504022293""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1504022297""}]",4,1,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bPF3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bPF3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",315,1

Although he realizes that Lotte is to marry Albert, he is unable to subdue his passion for her, and his infatuation torments him to the point of absolute despair. The first great 'confessional' novel, drawing both on Goethe's own unrequited love for Charlotte Buff and on the death of his friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem. Goethe's sensitive exploration of the mind of a young artist at odds with soceity and ill-equipped to cope with life is now considered the first great tragic novel of European literature.

The work, which was published posthumously sometime between 1740 and 1766, is comprised of stories varying in length. While the main characters of this book apparently are ghosts, foxes, immortals and demons, Pu Songling is more focused on the real life of commoners. Four main themes run throughout the book. The first is the author's complaint with the existing feudal system, which he finds to be unjust and skewed towards the elite. Secondly the author is concerned with the corruption that exists in the Imperial examination system. Thirdly the author shows his admiration of pure, faithful love between poor scholars and powerless women. And lastly is the overarching theme of morality for which Pu Songling intended ""Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio"" to be instructive towards bettering.

176,"Between Hell and Reason","Wesleyan University Press","From 1943 to 1947, Albert Camus was editor-in-chief of the famous underground and post-Liberation French newspaper Combat. Among his journalist writings during this period were eloquent essays that grappled with questions of revolution, violence, freedom, justice, ethics, and the emerging social order. The 41 pieces collected here--most never before published in English--tell the story of a sensitive man's odyssey from ""hell to reason"" at a time of tremendous upheaval while also providing a missing link between Camus's pre-war and post-war works. Almost lyrical in their intensity of thought and language, these newspaper pieces show a Camus new to most American readers and are a unique testimony to an extraordinary period in history with parallels to current changes in Eastern Europe. At the time of Liberation in 1944, Camus called for a revolution in French society, including a violent purge of those who had sided with the Nazis. When this turned into a near civil war of personal vendettas and summary executions, he gradually became disillusioned with his hopes for a new society. His later pieces in Combat show him arriving at a more moderate theory of revolt later echoed in such books as The Plague and The Rebel: the individual mattered above all, human life was greater than social goals. ""I have come to the conclusion"", he wrote, ""that men who want to change the world today must choose one of the following: the charnel house, the impossible dream of stopping history, or the acceptance of a relative Utopia that still leaves man the choice to act freely"".","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0819551899""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780819551894""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dhf5ccS-u_QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dhf5ccS-u_QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",194,16

This classic is part of The Great Books Series by Golding Books. An allegorical novel (or precisely a novella) like no other, Heart of Darkness is a masterpiece of psychological fiction and one of many classic sea stories from Joseph Conrad, though the action predominantly takes place on the Congo River. Charles Marlow captains a steamboat for an ivory trading company, and grows obsessed with ivory trader Kurtz, who has turned himself into a charismatic demigod of the local tribes. Heart of Darkness examines what it means to be civilized, and in asking questions about imperialism and racism it suggests much about who people at the time called ""savages"" and who is the cause of darkness. It is one of the most gripping and incisive of dark classics, and is also an excellent introductory point to classic and complex short novels or more serious literature (including its suitability as young adult literature). Golding Books' Great Books Series, along with its Essential Series, comprises a wide variety of classic, influential and important books. These two series aim to champion not only remarkable and recognized literary achievements, but also to highlight the meaningful and significant works of lesser-known authors. Get your copy of the titles through convenient online purchase as an eBook or in paperback (including some Large Print editions). Joseph Conrad was born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine, and once part of the Kingdom of Poland) in 1857. Because of his father's attempts at farming and political activism, the family moved repeatedly (such as to Warsaw, Vologda, and Chernihiv) and Conrad was home-schooled. An aloof and often depressed man, 20-year-old Conrad attempted suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a revolver. Born a Russian subject, he was granted British nationality in 1886 after joining the British merchant marine in 1878, and eventually settled in Kent, England. About half of his 19-year merchant marine career was spent at sea; he achieved captain's rank after working in numerous crew roles. His most popular novels include The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' (1897), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900), Typhoon (1902), Nostromo (1904), and The Secret Agent (1907).

The two men impress each other enough that the anarchist introduces Symes to a seven-man council of anarchists, all named after days of the week. Soon they elect Symes their newest member-Thursday.

185,"Green Wheat",none,"Written in 1923, ""Green Wheat ""is set in a villa in Brittany and is a story of burgeoning sexuality. This edition does more than meet Rogow's mark ""to do justice to Colette's enormous talent,"" it presents a great classic to the world once again. From the Translator's Preface: Of her more than twenty books, ""Green Wheat ""is perhaps Colette's most polished, most perfect. It was in Green Wheat that she achieved an exquisite blend of two of her greatest gifts as a fiction writer--her uncanny ability to fathom the hearts of adolescents, and her skill at describing nature with the phrasing of a poet and the colors and light of a great landscape painter. This combination helps make ""Green Wheat ""one of the enduring works of fiction of the last 100 years. . . . Ultimately, the book is a story about the loss of Eden, both of youth and of nature. . . . It is about the loss of a type of hope, a hope that many of us cling to, that love can somehow escape the imperfections of life.

He teaches in the M.F.A. in Writing Program at the California College of Arts & Crafts and lives in San Francisco. Colette, whose real name was Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, was born in the village of Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye in Burgundy, France in 1873 and died in Paris in 1954. Her many books include ""Gigi ""(1944), ""The Vagabond ""(1912), ""Cheri ""(1929), and ""The Last of Cheri ""(1932). She is considered one of the great novelists of the 20th century. Among her many awards, Colette was made a member of the Belgian Royal Academy in the 1930s and was also the first woman to be admitted to the prestigious Goncourt Academy.

196,"Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky (Illustrated)",unknown,"No library's complete without the classics! The two years before he wrote Crime and Punishment (1866) had been bad ones for Dostoyevsky. His wife and brother had died; the magazine he and his brother had started, Epoch, collapsed under its load of debt; and he was threatened with debtor's prison. With an advance that he managed to wangle for an unwritten novel, he fled to Wiesbaden, hoping to win enough at the roulette table to get himself out of debt. Instead, he lost all his money; he had to pawn his clothes and beg friends for loans to pay his hotel bill and get back to Russia. One of his begging letters went to a magazine editor, asking for an advance on yet another unwritten novel -- which he described as Crime and Punishment. One of the supreme masterpieces of world literature, Crime and Punishment catapulted Dostoyevsky to the forefront of Russian writers and into the ranks of the world's greatest novelists. Drawing upon experiences from his own prison days, the author recounts in feverish, compelling tones the story of Raskolnikov, an impoverished student tormented by his own nihilism, and the struggle between good and evil. Believing that he is above the law, and convinced that humanitarian ends justify vile means, he brutally murders an old woman -- a pawnbroker whom he regards as ""stupid, ailing, greedy...good for nothing."" Overwhelmed afterwards by feelings of guilt and terror, Raskolnikov confesses to the crime and goes to prison. There he realizes that happiness and redemption can only be achieved through suffering. Infused with forceful religious, social, and philosophical elements, the novel was an immediate success.

198,Candide,"Createspace Independent Publishing Platform","Candide is a French satire first published in 1759 by Voltaire, a philosopher of the Age of Enlightenment. The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: or, Optimism (1947). It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism (or simply ""optimism"") by his mentor, Professor Pangloss. The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow, painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, ""we must cultivate our garden"", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, ""all is for the best"" in the ""best of all possible worlds"". Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone as well as by its erratic, fantastical and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious bildungsroman, it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism. As expected by Voltaire, Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, the book was widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, Candide is recognized as Voltaire's magnum opus and is often listed as part of the Western canon; it is arguably taught more than any other work of French literature. Martin Seymour-Smith has listed Candide as one of The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1983671347""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781983671340""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v4jXtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v4jXtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api""}",50,1

217,"Man in the Dark",Macmillan,"""I am alone in the dark, turning the world around in my head as I struggle through another bout of insomnia, another white night in the great American wilderness."" So begins Paul Auster's brilliant, devastating tale about the many realities we inhabit as wars flame all around us. Seventy-two-year-old August Brill is recovering from a car accident in his daughter's house in Vermont. When sleep refuses to come, he lies in bed and tells himself stories, struggling to push back thoughts about things he would prefer to forget ? his wife's recent death and the horrific murder of his granddaughter's boyfriend, Titus. The retired book critic imagines a parallel world in which America is not at war with Iraq but with itself. In this other America the twin towers did not fall, and the 2000 election results led to secession, as state after state pulled away from the union, and a bloody civil war ensued. As the night progresses, Brill's story grows increasingly intense, and what he is so desperately trying to avoid insists on being told. Joined in the early hours by his granddaughter, he gradually opens up to her and recounts the story of his marriage. After she falls asleep, he at last finds the courage to revisit the trauma of Titus's death. Passionate and shocking, Man in the Dark is a story of our moment, an audiobook that forces us to confront the blackness of night even as it celebrates the existence of ordinary joys in a world capable of the most grotesque violence.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780312356583""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0312356587""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O6arfTwdi6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O6arfTwdi6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",164,1

224,"The Dream of the Celt","Macmillan + ORM","This “vast and intriguing novel” explores the life of an Irish nationalist who exposed Britain’s colonial crimes—by the Nobel Prize–winning author (Guardian, UK). In 1916, the Irish nationalist Roger Casement was hanged by the British government for treason. Casement had dedicated his extraordinary life to improving the plight of oppressed peoples around the world—especially the native populations in the Belgian Congo and the Amazon. But when he dared to draw a parallel between the injustices he witnessed in African and American colonies and those committed by the British in Northern Ireland, he became involved in a cause that led to his imprisonment and execution. When Casement’s homosexuality was revealed by his prosecutors—who drew excerpts from his personal “black diary”—the resulting scandal tainted his image to such a degree that his pioneering human rights work was nearly forgotten to history. In The Dream of the Celt, Mario Vargas Llosa—one of Latin America’s most vibrant, provocative, and necessary literary voices—brings this complex character to life as no other writer can. A masterful work, sharply translated by Edith Grossman, The Dream of the Celt tackles a controversial man whose story has long been neglected, and, in so doing, pushes at the boundaries of the historical novel.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781466816169""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1466816163""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1RKjZlrYouEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1RKjZlrYouEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",455,1

A Writer's Diary began as a column in a literary journal, but by 1876 Dostoevsky was able to bring it out as a complete monthly publication with himself as an editor, publisher, and sole contributor, suspending work on The Brothers Karamazov to do so. The Diary's radical format was matched by the extreme range of its contents. In a single frame it incorporated an astonishing variety of material: short stories; humorous sketches; reports on sensational crimes; historical predictions; portraits of famous people; autobiographical pieces; and plans for stories, some of which were never written while others appeared later in the Diary itself. A range of authorial and narrative voices and stances and an elaborate scheme of allusions and cross-references preserve and present Dostoevsky's conception of his work as a literary whole.

An existence. A book with no words.” Tom Hazard has just moved back to London, his old home, to settle down and become a high school history teacher. And on his first day at school, he meets a captivating French teacher at his school who seems fascinated by him. But Tom has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old, but owing to a rare condition, he's been alive for centuries.

He was an instant hit with the public with his incisive mind and fearless approach to the truth. At a time when forensic science was just beginning to emerge, Holmes became the master of arcane knowledge and the criminal mind. His stunning leaps of deduction were the bane of England's evildoers and the envy of Scotland Yard. Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes off in 1891 when he tired of writing the stories, but public demand forced him to revive his hero shortly thereafter, and he continued with further adventures until 1927. Doyle wrote four Sherlock Holmes novels, and his short stories have been collected into five anthologies. Published over an astounding forty years, from A Study in Scarlet in 1887, to his final short stories published between 1921 and 1927, Holmes continues to thrill today. His name still evokes a vision of the smoking pipe and deerstalker hat, and remains synonymous with clever deduction and the ability to ferret out the truth from a maze of conflicting evidence.

275,"The Plague",Vintage,"“Its relevance lashes you across the face.” —Stephen Metcalf, The Los Angeles Times • “A redemptive book, one that wills the reader to believe, even in a time of despair.” —Roger Lowenstein, The Washington Post A haunting tale of human resilience and hope in the face of unrelieved horror, Albert Camus' iconic novel about an epidemic ravaging the people of a North African coastal town is a classic of twentieth-century literature. The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr. Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France's suffering under the Nazi occupation, and a timeless story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780679720218""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0679720219""}]",4,14,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",312,1

278,Childhood,"Graphic Arts Books","Childhood (1852) is a novel by Leo Tolstoy. Published at the beginning of his career as a leading Russian author of his generation, Childhood is the first in a trilogy of semi-autobiographical novels tracing Nikolenka’s journey from innocence to experience. As a record of the past, a nostalgic reminder of a lost world, Childhood is one of Tolstoy’s most personal works, and yet his prose shows signs of the universal religious and philosophical themes that would inspire such masterpieces as War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). A story of life and death, love and grief, Childhood is an invaluable treasure of Russian literature. “How beautiful Mamma’s face was when she smiled! It made her so infinitely more charming, and everything around her seemed to grow brighter! If in the more painful moments of my life I could have seen that smile before my eyes, I should never have known what grief is.” Devoted to his mother, Nikolenka is a young Russian boy born into prosperity. As his story unfolds, we see him experience love, grief, and anger for the first time in his life, returning us for a brief moment to our own childhoods, the bittersweet memories of good and bad things that can never return. Praised for its expressionistic style and meditative prose, Childhood won Tolstoy the attention of Russia’s literary elite, launching his career as one of the nineteenth century’s most influential artists. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Leo Tolstoy’s Childhood is a classic work of Russian literature reimagined for modern readers.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781513294124""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1513294121""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qwgxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qwgxEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",96,1

Although employed as a Privy Councillor at the Duke of Weimar’s court, where he helped oversee major mining, road-building and irrigation projects, he also painted, directed plays, carried out research in anatomy, botany and optics – and still found time to produce masterpieces in every literary genre. His fourteen hundred Maxims and Reflections reveal some of his deepest thought on art, ethics, literature and natural science, but also his immediate reactions to books, chance encounters or his administrative work. Although variable in quality, the vast majority have a freshness and immediacy which vividly conjure up Goethe the man. They make an ideal introduction to one of the greatest of European writers.

Miles is haunted by guilt for having inadvertently caused the death of his step-brother, a situation that caused him to flee his father and step-mother in New York seven years ago. What keeps him in Florida is his relationship with a teenage high-school girl, Pilar, but when her family threatens to expose their relationship, Miles decides to protect Pilar by going back to Brooklyn, where he settles in a squat to prepare himself to face the inevitable confrontation with his father - a confrontation he has been avoiding for years. Set against the backdrop of the devastating global recession, and pulsing with the energy of Auster's previous novel Invisible, Sunset Park is as mythic as it is contemporary, as in love with baseball as it is with literature. It is above all, a story about love and forgiveness - not only among men and women, but also between fathers and sons.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780571258840""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0571258840""}]",4,1,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WK_mPzxMFfoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WK_mPzxMFfoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",318,1

Now, in the early weeks of his bereavement, Ivan meets Margaret, an older woman emerging from her own turbulent past, and their lives become rapidly and intensely intertwined.

He is torn between two identities, the one consecrated to God, the other devoted only to art and his imagination, and in time, his artistic gift threatens to estrange him from that world and the parents he adores.

That is a classic of children's literature, with the title character's name becoming a popular term for someone with the same very optimistic outlook.[1] Also, the subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle. The book was such a success that Porter soon produced a sequel, Pollyanna Grows Up (1915). Eleven more Pollyanna sequels, known as ""Glad Books"", were later published, most of them written by Elizabeth Borton or Harriet Lummis Smith. Further sequels followed, including Pollyanna Plays the Game by Colleen L. Reece, published in 1997. Plot : The title character is named Pollyanna Whittier, a young orphan who goes to live in the fictional town of Beldingsville, Vermont, with her wealthy but stern and cold spinster Aunt Polly, who does not want to take in Pollyanna but feels it is her duty to her late sister. Pollyanna's philosophy of life centers on what she calls ""The Glad Game,"" an optimistic and positive attitude she learned from her father. The game consists of finding something to be glad about in every situation, no matter how bleak it may be. It originated in an incident one Christmas when Pollyanna, who was hoping for a doll in the missionary barrel, found only a pair of crutches inside. Making the game up on the spot, Pollyanna's father taught her to look at the good side of things-in this case, to be glad about the crutches because they didn't need to use them. With this philosophy, and her own sunny personality and sincere, sympathetic soul, Pollyanna brings so much gladness to her aunt's dispirited New England town that she transforms it into a pleasant place to live.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1546674934""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781546674931""}]",0,0,"""none""",230,1

First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922. The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the ""Jazz Age."" Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the ""roaring"" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.

For more than thirty-five years, Stephen King has dazzled readers with his genius as a writer of short fiction. In this new collection he introduces each story with a passage about its origins or his motivations for writing it. As Entertainment Weekly said about this collection: “Bazaar of Bad Dreams is bursting with classic King terror, but what we love most are the thoughtful introductions he gives to each tale that explain what was going on in his life as he wrote it."" There are thrilling connections between stories; themes of morality, the afterlife, guilt, what we would do differently if we could see into the future or correct the mistakes of the past. In “Afterlife,” a man who died of colon cancer keeps reliving the same life, repeating his mistakes over and over again. Several stories feature characters at the end of life, revisiting their crimes and misdemeanors. Others address what happens when someone discovers that he has supernatural powers—the columnist who kills people by writing their obituaries in “Obits;” the old judge in “The Dune” who, as a boy, canoed to a deserted island and saw names written in the sand, people who then died in freak accidents. In “Morality,” King looks at how a marriage and two lives fall apart after the wife and husband enter into what seems, at first, a devil’s pact they can win. “I made these stories especially for you,” says King. “Feel free to examine them, but please be careful. The best of them have teeth.” Stories include: -Mile 81 -Premium Harmony -Batman and Robin Have an Altercation -The Dune -Bad Little Kid -A Death -The Bone Church -Morality -Afterlife -Ur -Herman Wouk Is Still Alive -Under the Weather -Blockade Billy -Mister Yummy -Tommy -The Little Green God of Agony -Cookie Jar -That Bus Is Another World -Obits -Drunken Fireworks -Summer Thunder","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1501197959""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781501197956""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TLvhyQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TLvhyQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api""}",0,1

The Tragedy of King Lear, a more theatrical version, was included in the 1623 First Folio.

That was all of it. A grace so ordinary there was no reason at all to remember it. Yet I have never across the forty years since it was spoken forgotten a single word.” New Bremen, Minnesota, 1961. The Twins were playing their debut season, ice-cold root beers were selling out at the soda counter of Halderson’s Drugstore, and Hot Stuff comic books were a mainstay on every barbershop magazine rack. It was a time of innocence and hope for a country with a new, young president. But for thirteen-year-old Frank Drum it was a grim summer in which death visited frequently and assumed many forms. Accident. Nature. Suicide. Murder. Frank begins the season preoccupied with the concerns of any teenage boy, but when tragedy unexpectedly strikes his family—which includes his Methodist minister father; his passionate, artistic mother; Juilliard-bound older sister; and wise-beyond-his-years kid brother—he finds himself thrust into an adult world full of secrets, lies, adultery, and betrayal, suddenly called upon to demonstrate a maturity and gumption beyond his years. Told from Frank’s perspective forty years after that fateful summer, Ordinary Grace is a brilliantly moving account of a boy standing at the door of his young manhood, trying to understand a world that seems to be falling apart around him.

As in many of Dostoyevsky's novels, the plot centers on a murder. Three brothers, different in character but bound by their ancestry, are drawn into the crime's vortex: Dmitri, a young officer utterly unrestrained in love, hatred, jealousy, and generosity; Ivan, an intellectual capable of delivering impromptu disquisitions about good and evil, God, and the devil; and Alyosha, the youngest brother, preternaturally patient, kind, and loving.

Today he is remembered for his epigrams, plays and the strange circumstances of his imprisonment, followed by his early death. At the turn of the 1890s, Wilde refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote Salome (1891) in French in Paris but it was refused a license. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London.

Innocence, experience, truth, deceit, loss, and recovery are at the core of these five interconnected, sequential tales—each deeply rooted in the 1960s, and each scarred by the Vietnam War, which continues to cast its shadow over American lives, politics and culture. In Part One, “Low Men in Yellow Coats,” eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest, and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. In “Blind Willie” and “Why We’re in Vietnam,” two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow—and as haunted—as their own lives. And in “Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,” this remarkable book’s denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart’s desire may await him. Full of danger and suspense, full of heart, this spellbinding fiction will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely forget.

338,Macbeth,"Diamond Pocket Books Pvt Ltd","Macbeth by William Shakespeare is a timeless tragedy that explores the devastating effects of ambition, power, and guilt. The plot of ""Macbeth"" is full of intrigue, betrayal, and supernatural elements, making it captivating for audiences. Set in Scotland, the play follows the rise and fall of Macbeth, a valiant soldier whose encounter with three witches ignites a fierce desire for power. At the beginning of the play, Macbeth is a loyal thane to King Duncan. However, his ambition is sparked when the witches prophesize that he will become the King of Scotland. Encouraged and manipulated by his wife, Lady Macbeth, he is driven to murder King Duncan in order to seize the throne. This act of regicide marks the beginning of Macbeths descent into tyranny and madness. Once crowned king, Macbeth's paranoia and guilt spiral out of control. He becomes obsessed with securing his power, leading him to commit further atrocities, including the murder of his friend Banquo, whom he perceives as a threat due to the witches prophecy that Banquo's descendants will inherit the throne. Macbeths ruthless actions isolate him from those around him, and he becomes a tyrannical ruler, feared and despised by his subjects. Lady Macbeth, initially the more ambitious and ruthless of the two, is eventually consumed by guilt and descends into madness. Her famous sleepwalking scene reveals the deep psychological torment she suffers as a result of her role in Duncans murder. Her decline mirrors Macbeths own unraveling, highlighting the corrupting power of unchecked ambition and guilt. The play reaches its climax as Macbeth faces a rebellion led by Macduff and Malcolm, Duncans son. The witches' prophecies, which seemed to guarantee Macbeth's invincibility, ultimately lead to his downfall as they are revealed to be equivocal. In a final confrontation, Macduff kills Macbeth, and Malcolm is restored to the throne, bringing a sense of moral resolution to the chaos that has ensued. Macbeth is a profound examination of the corrupting influence of ambition, the moral consequences of betrayal and murder, and the psychological effects of guilt and paranoia. Shakespeares masterful use of language, complex characters, and exploration of dark themes makes Macbeth a powerful and enduring tragedy that continues to captivate and provoke audience centuries after it was written.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9789362974631""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""9362974630""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_tMNEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_tMNEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",156,24
339,"The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick","Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","A glimpse into the mind of the bestselling science fiction author through a collection of his personal, metaphysical, religious, visionary writings. Based on thousands of pages of typed and handwritten notes, journal entries, letters, and story sketches, The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick is the magnificent and imaginative final work of an author who dedicated his life to questioning the nature of reality and perception, the malleability of space and time, and the relationship between the human and the divine. Edited and introduced by Pamela Jackson and Jonathan Lethem, this will be the definitive presentation of Dick’s brilliant, and epic, final work. In The Exegesis, Dick documents his eight-year attempt to fathom what he called “2-3-74,” a postmodern visionary experience of the entire universe “transformed into information.” In entries that sometimes ran to hundreds of pages, Dick tried to write his way into the heart of a cosmic mystery that tested his powers of imagination and invention to the limit, adding to, revising, and discarding theory after theory, mixing in dreams and visionary experiences as they occurred, and pulling it all together in three late novels known as the VALIS trilogy.

But the dreams—invasive images of blood and brutality—torture her, driving Yeong-hye to purge her mind and renounce eating meat altogether. It’s a small act of independence, but it interrupts her marriage and sets into motion an increasingly grotesque chain of events at home. As her husband, her brother-in-law and sister each fight to reassert their control, Yeong-hye obsessively defends the choice that’s become sacred to her. Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive and perverse violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement, not only from those closest to her, but also from herself.

That is a classic of children's literature, with the title character's name becoming a popular term for someone with the same very optimistic outlook.[1] Also, the subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle. The book was such a success that Porter soon produced a sequel, Pollyanna Grows Up (1915). Eleven more Pollyanna sequels, known as ""Glad Books"", were later published, most of them written by Elizabeth Borton or Harriet Lummis Smith. Further sequels followed, including Pollyanna Plays the Game by Colleen L. Reece, published in 1997. Plot : The title character is named Pollyanna Whittier, a young orphan who goes to live in the fictional town of Beldingsville, Vermont, with her wealthy but stern and cold spinster Aunt Polly, who does not want to take in Pollyanna but feels it is her duty to her late sister. Pollyanna's philosophy of life centers on what she calls ""The Glad Game,"" an optimistic and positive attitude she learned from her father. The game consists of finding something to be glad about in every situation, no matter how bleak it may be. It originated in an incident one Christmas when Pollyanna, who was hoping for a doll in the missionary barrel, found only a pair of crutches inside. Making the game up on the spot, Pollyanna's father taught her to look at the good side of things-in this case, to be glad about the crutches because they didn't need to use them. With this philosophy, and her own sunny personality and sincere, sympathetic soul, Pollyanna brings so much gladness to her aunt's dispirited New England town that she transforms it into a pleasant place to live.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1546674934""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781546674931""}]",0,0,"""none""",230,1

Though he was virtually unknown to American audiences at the time, all that was about to change—The Stranger, his first book translated into English, would soon make him a literary star. By 1949, when he set out on a tour of South America, Camus was an international celebrity. Camus’s journals offer an intimate glimpse into his daily life during these eventful years and showcase his thinking at its most personal—a form of observational writing that the French call choses vues (things seen). Camus’s journals from these travels record his impressions, frustrations, joys, and longings. Here are his unguarded first impressions of his surroundings and his encounters with publishers, critics, and members of the New York intelligentsia. Long unavailable in English, the journals have now been expertly retranslated by Ryan Bloom, with a new introduction by Alice Kaplan. Bloom’s translation captures the informal, sketch-like quality of Camus’s observations—by turns ironic, bitter, cutting, and melancholy—and the quick notes he must have taken after exhausting days of travel and lecturing. Bloom and Kaplan’s notes and annotations allow readers to walk beside the existentialist thinker as he experiences changes in his own life and the world around him, all in his inimitable style.","[{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780226694955""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""022669495X""}]",0,0,"{""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=deimEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=deimEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}",153,21
